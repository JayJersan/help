title: Onboard Prompt Firewall App
description: Learn how to onboard your application with AccuKnox Prompt Firewall using the Python SDK. This guide covers steps from application registration to scanning prompts and responses for sensitive information.

## Steps to Get Started


### **1. Add Application**

Click on **"Add Application"** as shown below.

![image-20250114-184710.png](./images/llm-defense-app-onboard/1.png)

Enter the **Application Name** and **Tags**, then click the **Add** button.

Enter the application details.

### **2. Save Your Token**

Copy the **Accuknox_token** and store it securely for later use.

Copy the API token shown on the screen.

### **3. Install the SDK**

Inside the environment where your application is running, install the package:

```bash
pip install accuknox-llm-defense
```

For more details, see the [PyPI project page](https://pypi.org/project/accuknox-llm-defense/).

### **4. Initialize the Client**

Import the package and initialize the client with the token you obtained earlier:

```python
from accuknox_llm_defense import LLMDefenseClient

accuknox_client = LLMDefenseClient(
    llm_defense_api_key="<Accuknox_token>",
    user_info="<Enter your email/name>"
)
```

**Parameters:**

  * `llm_defense_api_key`: Your Accuknox token
  * `user_info`: User information (e.g., email)

### **5. Prompt Scanning**

Scan a prompt before sending it to your LLM:

```python
prompt = "<Pass the prompt to be sent to LLM>"
sanitized_prompt_dict = accuknox_client.scan_prompt(content=prompt)
sanitized_prompt = sanitized_prompt_dict.get("sanitized_content")
```

**Parameters:**

  * `content`: The prompt to be scanned before sending to the LLM.

**Return Value (Dictionary):**

  - `query_status` (str): One of ["UNCHECKED", "PASS", "MONITOR", "BLOCK"]. A value of "BLOCK" means the prompt violated at least one blocking policy and should not be processed further.
  - `sanitized_content` (str): The cleaned and safe version of the original prompt.
  - `session_id` (str): A unique identifier that must be passed when scanning the corresponding LLM response.
  - `risk_score` (dict): Extra debug data showing the risk scores assigned by different policies. Has no functional use.

Less likely, but if an unexpected internal error occurs, only present key will be `error`.

### **6. Response Scanning**

Scan the response received from your LLM:

```python
response = "<Response received from LLM>"
sanitized_response_dict = accuknox_client.scan_response(
    content=response,
    prompt=sanitized_prompt_dict.get("sanitized_content"),
    session_id=sanitized_prompt_dict.get("session_id")
)
sanitized_response = sanitized_response_dict.get("sanitized_content")
```

**Parameters:**

  * `content`: The response obtained from the LLM.
  * `prompt`: The sanitized prompt used to generate the response.
  * `session_id`: The session ID obtained during prompt scanning.

**Return Value (Dictionary):**

  - `query_status` (str): One of ["UNCHECKED", "PASS", "MONITOR", "BLOCK"]. "BLOCK" means the response violated a configured blocking policy.
  - `sanitized_content` (str): The sanitized version of the LLM response.
  - `risk_score` (dict): Contains per-policy risk scores for debugging. Has no functional use.

Less likely, but if an unexpected internal error occurs, only present key will be `error`.

!!! note "Important"
    The `session_id` is used to link a prompt and its corresponding response. If you don't provide it, prompts and responses will be treated as separate findings.
